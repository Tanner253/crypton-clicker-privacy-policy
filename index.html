Participation in the Game does not constitute an investment, and you should have no expectation of profit, income, or any financial return. The Game and its contents do not constitute financial advice.</li>
      <li><strong>No Guarantees:</strong> We make absolutely no promises or guarantees regarding the value, availability, or continued existence of any In-Game Items. We reserve the right to modify, manage, control, or eliminate In-Game Items at our sole discretion, and we will have no liability to you or any third party for the exercise of such rights.</li>

  <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

  <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
  <p>We collect the following limited information to operate and improve the Game:</p>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>Information You Provide:</strong> We collect your Date of Birth (DOB) solely for age verification. We do not store this information after verification. We also collect any information you provide when contacting us for support.</li>
      <li><strong>Automatically Collected Information:</strong> We and our service providers may automatically collect your device identifier, advertising ID, IP address, and operating system to provide core functionality and serve advertisements.</li>
      <li><strong>Game and Chat Data:</strong> We collect chat messages, a randomly generated identifier for your device, and your optional username to support the in-game chat system. Your game progress is saved locally on your device.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2. How We Use Your Information</h3>
  <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Provide, maintain, and improve the Game.</li>
      <li>Verify your age to comply with legal requirements like COPPA.</li>
      <li>Enable and moderate the in-game chat functionality.</li>
      <li>Serve contextual and personalized advertisements.</li>
      <li>Respond to your support requests.</li>
      <li>Monitor and analyze trends and usage of our Game.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>3. Chat Functionality</h3>
  <p>The in-game chat system follows these privacy and safety principles:</p>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>Content Moderation:</strong> All chat messages are filtered to remove inappropriate content.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Storage:</strong> Chat messages are stored temporarily to facilitate communication and are not permanently retained.</li>
      <li><strong>User Control:</strong> The chat feature can be disabled at any time through game settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Reporting:</strong> Users can report inappropriate messages or behavior through an in-game reporting system.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4. Third-Party Services & Advertising</h3>
  <p>We work with third-party partners for core functionality and advertising. These services operate under their own privacy policies.</p>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>Ad Networks:</strong> Our advertising partners (e.g., Google AdMob, Unity Ads) use advertising IDs and similar technologies to serve personalized ads.</li>
      <li><strong>Firebase:</strong> We use Firebase Realtime Database to securely transmit chat messages and Firebase Authentication to generate anonymous user identifiers for the chat feature.</li>
      <li><strong>Game Engine & Publisher:</strong> The Game is built with Unity and published on platforms like the Google Play Store, which may collect their own diagnostic data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>5. Data Security</h3>
  <p>We implement reasonable security measures to protect your information from loss, theft, and unauthorized access. Chat messages and user identifiers are encrypted during transmission and storage to protect user privacy.</p>

  <h3>6. Children's Privacy</h3>
  <p>Our Game complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We use a neutral age-gate (DOB capture) to prevent children under 13 (or the relevant age in your jurisdiction) from accessing features that collect personal information. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. The chat feature includes enhanced protections for younger users, including stricter content filtering.</p>

  <h3>7. Your Rights</h3>
  <p>You have the right to:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Disable the chat functionality at any time in the game settings.</li>
      <li>Request deletion of your device identifier and any associated chat data by contacting us.</li>
      <li>Report concerns about our privacy practices.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>8. Changes to this Policy</h3>
  <p>We may change these Terms and the Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the "Effective Date" at the top of the policy.</p>
