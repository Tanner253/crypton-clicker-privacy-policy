  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> May 15, 2024</p>
  
  <div class="update-note">
    <p><strong>Policy Update Notice:</strong> This privacy policy has been updated to include information about our in-game chat functionality. Please review the changes below.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>Crypton Clicker collects minimal data to provide core functionality and now includes an optional in-game chat system. This policy outlines what information is collected and how it is used.</p>

  <h2>Data Collection</h2>
  <p>We collect the following limited information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Device Identifier:</strong> A randomly generated identifier stored on your device to support chat functionality and local game saves</li>
    <li><strong>Chat Messages:</strong> Messages you send in the in-game chat system are temporarily stored to enable communication between players</li>
    <li><strong>Username:</strong> If you choose to set a custom username for the chat feature, this is stored locally on your device</li>
    <li><strong>Game Progress Data:</strong> Your game progress is saved locally on your device</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>We do not collect any of the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Personal information (name, email, address, etc.)</li>
    <li>Location data</li>
    <li>Browsing history</li>
    <li>Any data from third-party SDKs or APIs not specified in this policy</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Chat Functionality</h2>
  <p>The in-game chat system follows these privacy and safety principles:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Content Moderation:</strong> All chat messages are filtered to remove inappropriate content</li>
    <li><strong>Data Storage:</strong> Chat messages are stored temporarily to facilitate communication and are not permanently retained</li>
    <li><strong>User Control:</strong> The chat feature can be disabled at any time through game settings</li>
    <li><strong>Children's Safety:</strong> Additional safeguards are implemented to protect users under 13 years of age in compliance with COPPA</li>
    <li><strong>Reporting:</strong> Users can report inappropriate messages or behavior through an in-game reporting system</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>This game is built using Unity 6 and published on the Google Play Store. While Unity and Google may have their own policies, Crypton Clicker only uses the following third-party services:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Firebase Realtime Database:</strong> Used to securely store and transmit chat messages (when chat functionality is enabled)</li>
    <li><strong>Firebase Authentication:</strong> Used to generate anonymous user identifiers for chat functionality (no personal information required)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These services operate under their own privacy policies and comply with GDPR, CCPA, and other relevant privacy regulations.</p>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>Chat messages and user identifiers are encrypted during transmission and storage to protect user privacy. We implement reasonable security measures to protect the limited data we collect.</p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>Crypton Clicker complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The chat feature includes enhanced protections for younger users, including stricter content filtering and limited interaction options.</p>

  <h2>Future Changes</h2>
  <p>If we decide to update the game to include any form of additional data collection (for analytics, crash reports, or otherwise), this privacy policy will be updated and users will be notified accordingly.</p>

  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You have the right to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Disable the chat functionality at any time</li>
    <li>Request deletion of your device identifier and any associated chat data</li>
    <li>Report concerns about privacy or data handling</li>
  </ul>
